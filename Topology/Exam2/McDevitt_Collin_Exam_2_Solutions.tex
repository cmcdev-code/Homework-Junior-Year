\subsection*{1.}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $X$ is a compact topological space and $f: X\to \mathbb R$ is as described. As $X$ is compact we have the open cover $\{U_x\}_{x\in X}$ where for each $U_x\in \{U_x\}_{x\in X}$ we have that there exists a constant $M_x$ such that for all $z\in U_x$ that $|f(z)|\leq M_x$. 
    
    Then as $X$ is compact we have that the collection has a finite subcover $\{U_{x_1},...,U_{x_n}\}$. Each of these in the finite subcover has a corresponding constant $\{M_{x_1},...,M_{x_n}\}$ with the property that for all $z\in U_{x_i}$ that $|f(z)|\leq M_{x_i}$ where $i=1,...,n$. Let $M=\max\{M_{x_1},...,M_{x_n}\}$ then for any $z\in X$ we have that $z\in U_{x_i}$ for some $i=1,...,n$. Hence $|f(z)|\leq M_{x_i}\leq M$ so this choice of $M$ works for all $z\in X$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{2.}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $X$ is a topological space $C$ is a connected subset of $X$ and $C_{\alpha}$ is a connected subset of $X$. With for all $\alpha A$ that $C_\alpha \bigcap C\not = \emptyset$. Suppose that $C\bigcup \big ( \cup _{\alpha \in A} C_\alpha \big)$ is not connected. Then there exists a separation $U\cup V$ of $C\bigcup \big(\cup _{\alpha \in A} C_\alpha \big)$. 
    
    Then as $C$ is connected we have either $C\subset U$ with $C\cap V=\emptyset$ or $C\subset V$ with $C\cap U=\emptyset$. If $C$ wasn't fully contained in only one then $(C\cap U)$, $(C\cap V)$ would be a separation of $C$ but $C$ is connected. For each $\alpha \in A$ we get that $C_\alpha$ is contained in exactly one $U$ or $V$.
    
    WLOG suppose $C\cup U$ then as $C\cap C_\alpha \not = \emptyset $ we get that $C_\alpha \subset U$. Hence we get $C\bigcup \big(\cup _{\alpha \in A}C_\alpha \big)\subset U$ and $\left(C\bigcup \big(U_{\alpha\in A} C_\alpha \big)\right) \bigcap V=\emptyset$ hence $V=\emptyset$ so this separation can not exist. So we have $C\bigcup \big( \cup _{\alpha \in A}C_\alpha \big)$ is connected. 
\end{proof}

\subsection*{3.}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item {We have that a set is closed if and only if it contains it's limit points. As any singleton in $\{1/n: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is ope. Which is shown as we have for any $1/n\in \{1/n:n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ we have that $(1/n-\epsilon, 1/n+\epsilon)$ for $\epsilon >0$ is open in $\mathbb{R}$ choosing a sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$ we get $(1/n-\epsilon,1/n+\epsilon)\cap \{1/n:n\in \mathbb{N}\}=\{1/n\}$. As the choice of $1/n$ was arbitrary we get that all singletons are open.
    
    Hence any $B\subset \{1/n: n\in \mathbb N\}$ we get that $B^\prime=\emptyset$ as for any $b\in \{1/n:n\in \mathbb N\}$ we have the neighborhood $\{b\}$ that doesn't intersect $B$ at any place other then possibly itself. Hence $B$ is closed as $B$ is arbitrary we have that all subsets are closed. 
    }
    \item {We have that all singletons other then $\{0\}$ are open using the same reasoning as above. Hence $\{1/n: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is open so we get $\{1/n: n\in \mathbb{N}\}^c=\{0\}$ is closed. We have that all singletons are closed as any singleton other than $\{0\}$ don't have any limit points. As finite unions of closed sets are closed then all finite subsets are closed. 
    
    Lastly any infinite set containing $0$ is closed. This is shown as let $B\subset \{0\}\cup \{1/n:n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ be an infinite set containing $0$. Then we have $B^c$ is a union of singletons each of which are open hence $B^c$ is open so $B$ is closed. 
    
    Any infinite set not containing $0$ is not closed as $0$ is a limit point of this set. 
    }
